üß† PROJECT DESCRIPTION: AI Chatbot with NLP (Using NLTK)
üìå Objective
To build a simple AI-powered chatbot that can understand and respond to user inputs using basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques powered by the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library in Python.

The chatbot:

Understands user input via keyword detection.

Preprocesses input using tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.

Identifies user intent based on predefined keywords.

Responds with appropriate answers from a small knowledge base.

üîß Key Components
Tokenization: Breaking input sentences into words.

Stopword Removal: Removing commonly used words (like "the", "is") that carry little meaning.

Lemmatization: Reducing words to their root form (e.g., "running" ‚Üí "run").

Intent Recognition: Matching keywords to detect user intent (e.g., greeting, thanks).

Response Generation: Selecting a response from a dictionary of possible replies.

üåç APPLICATIONS OF THIS CHATBOT
This type of chatbot, though simple, can serve as the foundation for many real-world systems:

‚úÖ 1. Customer Support (Basic Level)
Automatically reply to common questions like greetings, thank-yous, or exit commands.

Used on websites to reduce workload on human agents.

‚úÖ 2. Educational Platforms
Act as a tutor that responds to student questions with predefined answers.

Handle FAQ-style queries like "How to submit homework?" or "What are office hours?"

‚úÖ 3. Internal Tools / Company Helpdesk
Help employees navigate company policies (e.g., ‚Äúhow to apply for leave‚Äù).

First-level support before escalating to human HR or IT teams.

‚úÖ 4. Personal Assistant (Local Version)
Answer simple questions like reminders, greetings, or confirmations.

Serve as a starter project for a more intelligent voice assistant.

‚úÖ 5. Chatbot Learning Tools
Ideal for students learning NLP and AI, as it introduces:

Preprocessing

Basic AI logic

Great base to expand into machine learning-based or API-integrated bots.
